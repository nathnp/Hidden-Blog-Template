# Hidden Blog Template 

This is the [Blot.im](https://blot.im) template used on [rss.nthp.me](https://rss.nthp.me)

This template removes features, such as. 

1. All forms of post listings on the site. 

2. Next and previous post previews and the end of posts. 

Users must subscribe via RSS to view previous posts, and new posts. Users can still share posts by sharing the post’s link.
